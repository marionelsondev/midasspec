3. Ask the user clarifying questions about scope and behavior until the

      "Implement a spec's ready issues — manual, autonomous (auto), or parallel multi-agent (ultracode) mode",
    argumentHint: '[spec-slug] [manual|auto|ultracode]',
    body: `Implement the ready issues of a spec, in the execution mode the user chose.

## Step 0 — Determine the execution mode (REQUIRED before touching any issue)

The second argument selects the mode: \`manual\`, \`auto\`, or \`ultracode\`.
If it is missing, ASK the user which mode to use and WAIT for the answer —
do not pick, start, or implement any issue before the mode is known.
Present the options with their trade-offs:

- \`manual\` — one issue per run; the user reviews between issues. Slowest,
  full control.
- \`auto\` — implement every ready issue sequentially, autonomously, until the
  spec is done. Single agent, no questions in between.
- \`ultracode\` — spawn a parallel multi-agent workflow that plans and
  implements issues concurrently following the dependency graph. Fastest, but
  uses many agents and tokens; requires the user to have opted into ultracode.

In every mode, each issue follows the same tracked lifecycle so that
\`midas status\` reflects reality: \`midas start <spec-slug> <NN> --json\` when
work on the issue begins (marks it \`[~]\` in progress), and
\`midas done <spec-slug> <NN> --json\` only when it is implemented, tested,
and reviewed (marks it \`[x]\`).

## manual mode

1. Run \`midas issues <spec-slug> --ready --json\` to list issues whose
   blockers are all done. If none are ready, report progress and stop.
2. Pick one ready issue (the lowest number unless the user asked for a
   specific one) and read its markdown file — it is the contract.
3. Run \`midas start <spec-slug> <issue-number> --json\`.
4. Implement exactly what the issue describes, including the tests its
   Expected Result demands, and run the test suite until green.
5. Run \`midas done <spec-slug> <issue-number> --json\`.
6. Summarize what changed and which issues are now unblocked, then STOP and
   let the user review before the next issue. When no issues remain, suggest
   \`/midas:archive <spec-slug>\`.

## auto mode

Loop the manual steps (ready → pick lowest → start → implement → test →
done) without asking between issues: after each \`midas done\`, re-run
\`midas issues <spec-slug> --ready --json\` and continue with the next ready
issue until none remain. Then report a final summary of every issue
implemented and the test-suite result, and suggest \`/midas:archive <spec-slug>\`.

## ultracode mode

Build and run a parallel workflow driven by the dependency graph — no
fixed waves or barriers: everything runs as early as its dependencies allow,
and everything that can run in parallel does.

1. Read the full graph with \`midas issues <spec-slug> --json\`. Schedule by
   dependencies: each issue launches as soon as ALL of its \`blockedBy\`
   issues are done — never wait for an entire "batch" to finish.
2. Issues with no dependency between them but that touch the same files must
   run as one sequential chain; disjoint chains run concurrently.
3. Run each issue as a two-agent chain: a read-only planner agent (reads the
   issue file, the SPEC.md, and only the code it needs; returns a structured
   plan) feeding an implementer agent (implements the plan and writes the
   tests the issue's Expected Result demands; runs ONLY its own targeted
   test files — never the full suite or the build, to avoid clashing with
   parallel agents; never commits; never touches INDEX.md).
4. ONLY the orchestrator writes to INDEX.md, always one call at a time
   (parallel calls race on the file and lose updates): run
   \`midas start <spec-slug> <NN> --json\` immediately before launching an
   issue's chain, and \`midas done <spec-slug> <NN> --json\` as soon as that
   issue's chain finishes green.
5. After all issues finish, run a single verifier agent that executes the
   FULL test suite and the build, fixes any integration conflicts between
   issues, and re-runs until green.
6. Verify independently with \`midas status <spec-slug> --json\` and the full
   test suite, then summarize what changed per issue and suggest
   \`/midas:archive <spec-slug>\`.`,

3. Run \`midas archive <spec-slug> --json\` to move the spec to the archive.
